# Ryse_Tek - Robert Radford, Yoni Palagashvili, Seth Mcfeeters

## Communication plan: 
Work on remo throughout the day, exchanged phone numbers in case we can't contact through other planned methods. 0900 set meeting time to gurantee everyone has a chance to inquire about changing directions if they want to. Made a Slack group chat as well.

## Conflict plan: 
Morning meetings to gurantee everyones voice is heard, majority rules. If its a threeway tie of indecision have a discussion and layout a roadmap for the different methods and select the most clear concise choice.

## Work plan: 
We will layout a blueprint, create the tasks vaguely that will be necessary to reach the end goal, and place them into a Trello board and then divide up task assignment and work through them.

## Git process: 
Create a repo with a main, staging branch, and then each of our own working branches. Whenever a task is completed and code is functional push it into staging and each morning at the end of the meeting we can push staging to main.

## Any thing else you feel is important: 
Outside work is fine but expectations are only Monday-Friday, and approximately 8 hours a day.
